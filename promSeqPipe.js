/* Promise sequencing is essentially function piping demonstrated in the previous section, except done asynchronously.

// Compare this with pipe: fn(acc) is changed to acc.then(fn),

const asyncPipe =
  (...functions) =>
  (initialValue) =>
    functions.reduce((acc, fn) => acc.then(fn), Promise.resolve(initialValue));

// Building blocks to use for composition
const p1 = async (a) => a * 5;
const p2 = async (a) => a * 2;
// The composed functions can also return non-promises, because the values are
// all eventually wrapped in promises
const f3 = (a) => a * 3;
const p4 = async (a) => a * 4;

asyncPipe(p1, p2, f3, p4)(10).then(console.log); // 1200
